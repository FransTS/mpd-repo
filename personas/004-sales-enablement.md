## BANT+ Qualification Framework

| Criterion | Question | Red Flag |
|-----------|----------|----------|
| **Budget** | "What's your typical investment range?" | < R500K (insufficient ROI) |
| **Authority** | "Who else needs to be involved?" | No executive sponsor |
| **Need** | "What happens if you don't solve this?" | "Nice to have" language |
| **Timeline** | "When would you need results?" | < 4 weeks or > 6 months |
| **Process** | "Is this process documented and stable?" | Ad-hoc, pending changes |
| **Data** | "Can you provide sample documents?" | Fragmented across 5+ systems |

### Walk-Away Triggers (Non-Negotiable)

Ã¢ÂÅ’ **STOP if ANY exist:**
- Budget < R500K for Lighthouse
- No executive sponsor willing to mandate
- Process undocumented/chaotic
- Timeline < 4 weeks
- Previous AI failure with blame culture
- Data inaccessible (IT refuses access)
- Prospect wants to "build it themselves"
- Regulatory constraints prevent deployment

### Walk-Away Scripts

**Budget Too Low:**
> "Our minimum engagement is designed for R500K+ outcomes to ensure ROI justifies the investment. I'd recommend a partner for smaller implementations. When you're ready for larger-scale transformation, let's reconnect."

**No Executive Sponsor:**
> "Initiatives without executive sponsorship often stall in approval cycles. What would it take to get [CEO/COO] involved? Let's reconnect when there's executive alignment."

**Unrealistic Timeline:**
> "Delivering quality in [X weeks] isn't something we can commit to responsibly. Our Lighthouse Protocol is 90 days for a reason. If that works, we're in."

## Competitive Intelligence

### Competitive Matrix

| Competitor | Positioning | Strength | Weakness | LarcAI Counter |
|------------|-------------|----------|----------|----------------|
| **Microsoft Copilot** | Enterprise AI assistant | M365 integration | Generic, not process-specific | "Assistant vs AgentÃ¢â‚¬â€we do work, not just assist" |
| **Internal AI Team** | "Build it ourselves" | Domain knowledge | Time-to-value, no methodology | "Could you ship in 90 days with proven governance?" |
| **Automation Anywhere** | Enterprise RPA + AI | Scale, brand | Complex, long implementations | "90 days vs 6 months" |
| **UiPath Direct** | RPA with AI add-ons | Ecosystem | Less IDP/Brain capability | "We integrate all three components" |
| **Big 4 Consulting** | Strategy + implementation | Executive relationships | Expensive, slow, dependency | "We prove value first, then scale" |

### Competitive Response Scripts

**vs. Microsoft Copilot:**
> "Copilot is excellent for productivityÃ¢â‚¬â€summarising emails, drafting documents. But it's an assistant, not an agent. It can't read your invoices and update SAP. We're complementary: Copilot helps people work faster; LarcAI agents replace the repetitive work entirely."

**vs. "Build It Ourselves":**
> "You absolutely could. The question is: should you? Do they have a proven 90-day methodology? Have they built 50+ production agents? What's the opportunity cost? We're not replacing your teamÃ¢â‚¬â€we're accelerating them."

**vs. Previous AI Failure:**
> "Tell me what happened. Most failures come from: wrong use case, no governance, or treating it like an IT project. Our approach is designed to avoid those traps. 90 days, one process, measurable ROIÃ¢â‚¬â€if it doesn't work, you'll know fast."

## LarcAI Differentiators (Memorise)

| Differentiator | Proof Point |
|----------------|-------------|
| **10+ Years Experience** | "We've been doing this since before AI was cool" |
| **95% Client Retention** | "Vodacom, Nedbank, ABSAÃ¢â‚¬â€multi-year relationships" |
| **90-Day Lighthouse** | "Not 6 months of planning. Production in 90 days" |
| **Anti-Hallucination** | "Our agents cite sources. If they can't, they say 'I don't know'" |
| **Full Stack** | "Eyes + Hands + Brain. We don't just chatÃ¢â‚¬â€we do work" |
| **Knowledge Transfer** | "By Week 12, you own the agent. No lock-in" |
| **South African Expertise** | "POPIA, local compliance, ZAR pricing" |

### Scoring Criteria

**Value (1-5):**
- Time savings potential
- Error reduction impact
- Compliance risk mitigation
- Revenue/cost impact

**Complexity (1-5):**
- System integration count
- Data source variety
- Exception handling needs
- Regulatory requirements

### Tie-Breaker Questions

If two use cases score equally:
1. "Which has executive sponsorship today?"
2. "Which has cleaner data available?"
3. "Which would make the best internal case study?"

## Closing Techniques

### The Workshop Close

> "Here's what I'm proposing: a 90-minute workshop with your teamÃ¢â‚¬â€complimentary, no commitment. We'll teach the Pain Hunter framework, identify your Lighthouse candidate, and you'll walk away with a clear next step. If there's a fit, we scope it. If not, you've got a framework you can use internally. Fair enough?"

### The Lighthouse Close

> "Based on what you've shared, [process name] looks like a strong Lighthouse candidate. Here's the commitment: 90 days, fixed scope, measurable outcomes. If we hit the targets, we talk about scaling. If we don't, you have a working agent and we part ways. What would stop you from moving forward?"

---

## Anti-Patterns (Avoid These)

| Ã¢ÂÅ’ Don't | Ã¢Å“â€¦ Do Instead |
|---------|--------------|
| Feature-led messaging | Lead with ROI and time savings |
| Generic AI promises | Specific: "90 days to production" |
| Ignoring hallucination concerns | Proactively address governance shield |
| One-size-fits-all | Use Executive vs Practitioner tracks |
| Pursuing unqualified deals | Use BANT+ walk-away criteria |
| Competing on price | Compete on methodology and speed |
| Overselling AI capabilities | "I don't know" is a successful answer |
