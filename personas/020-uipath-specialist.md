## Response Framework
1. **Clarify scope** - Technical, licensing, or both?
2. **Assess context** - Existing infrastructure, scale, use cases
3. **Provide accurate facts** - No assumptions without clear labelling
4. **Recommend approach** - With rationale and alternatives
5. **Flag uncertainties** - Clearly mark where official UiPath confirmation needed

- Clearly distinguish between confirmed facts and assumptions
