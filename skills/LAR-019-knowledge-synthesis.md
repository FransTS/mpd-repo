## Source Evaluation Framework

### Credibility Assessment (CRAAP Test)

| Criterion | Questions | Score (1-5) |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| **C**urrency | When was it published? Is it current for this topic? | |
| **R**elevance | Does it relate to the specific question? | |
| **A**uthority | Who is the author? What are their credentials? | |
| **A**ccuracy | Is it supported by evidence? Can it be verified? | |
| **P**urpose | Why does this exist? Bias or agenda? | |

### Source Type Reliability

| Source Type | Default Confidence | Notes |
|-------------|-------------------|-------|
| Peer-reviewed research | High | Check methodology |
| Industry reports (Gartner, etc.) | High | May have sponsor bias |
| Company financials | High | Audited = higher |
| News (major outlets) | Medium-High | Cross-reference |
| Expert interviews | Medium | Individual perspective |
| Blog posts/opinions | Medium-Low | Depends on author |
| Social media | Low | Verify independently |
| Wikipedia | Medium | Check citations |
| AI-generated | Variable | Verify all claims |

## Synthesis Templates

### Multi-Source Research Synthesis

```markdown
# Research Synthesis: [Topic]

**Date:** [DD Month YYYY]
**Sources Reviewed:** [N] sources
**Confidence Level:** [High | Medium | Low]

## Executive Summary
[3-5 sentences synthesising the key findings across all sources]

## Key Findings

### Finding 1: [Theme/Topic]
[Synthesis of what sources say about this theme]

**Source Agreement:**
- âœ… Supported by: [Source A], [Source B], [Source C]
- âš ï¸ Contradicted by: [Source D] (reason: [explanation])

**Confidence:** [High/Medium/Low] - [Why]

### Finding 2: [Theme/Topic]
[Same structure]

## Points of Consensus
1. [Finding most sources agree on]
2. [Finding most sources agree on]

## Points of Disagreement
| Topic | View A (Sources) | View B (Sources) | Assessment |
|-------|------------------|------------------|------------|
| [Topic] | [Position] | [Position] | [Which is more credible and why] |

## Knowledge Gaps
- [ ] [What we don't know #1]
- [ ] [What we don't know #2]

## Source Summary

| Source | Type | Date | Key Contribution | Credibility |
|--------|------|------|------------------|-------------|
| [Source 1] | [Type] | [Date] | [What it adds] | [H/M/L] |
| [Source 2] | [Type] | [Date] | [What it adds] | [H/M/L] |

## Methodology
[How sources were found, selected, and analysed]
```

### Quick Synthesis (3-Source Minimum)

```markdown
## Synthesis: [Topic]

**Sources:** [N] | **Confidence:** [H/M/L]

### Bottom Line
[One paragraph synthesis]

### Key Points
1. **[Point]** (Sources: A, B, C) - [Confidence]
2. **[Point]** (Sources: A, D) - [Confidence]
3. **[Point]** (Source: B only) - [Confidence: Lower - single source]

### Contradictions
- [Source A] says X, but [Source B] says Y. Assessment: [Which is more credible]

### What We Don't Know
- [Gap 1]
```

---

## Handling Contradictions

### Contradiction Resolution Framework

```markdown
## Contradiction Analysis

**Topic:** [What sources disagree on]

**Position A:** [Statement]
- Sources: [List]
- Evidence strength: [Strong/Moderate/Weak]
- Potential bias: [None/Low/High]

**Position B:** [Statement]
- Sources: [List]
- Evidence strength: [Strong/Moderate/Weak]
- Potential bias: [None/Low/High]

**Resolution:**
â–¡ Position A is more credible because: [Reason]
â–¡ Position B is more credible because: [Reason]
â–¡ Both may be valid in different contexts: [Explanation]
â–¡ Insufficient evidence to resolve - flag as uncertainty

**Recommendation:** [How to proceed given this uncertainty]
```

---

## Confidence Level Definitions

| Level | Definition | When to Use |
|-------|------------|-------------|
| **High** | Multiple credible sources agree, recent data, verifiable | Strong consensus, quality sources |
| **Medium** | Some agreement, some gaps, or older data | Mixed sources, some uncertainty |
| **Low** | Single source, contradictions, or speculation | Limited evidence, needs verification |
| **Uncertain** | Cannot determine - major gaps or conflicts | Acknowledge and flag |

### Confidence Indicators in Output

```markdown
**High Confidence:** âœ… [Statement]
**Medium Confidence:** âš¡ [Statement]
**Low Confidence:** âš ï¸ [Statement]
**Uncertain:** â“ [Statement - needs verification]
```

---

## Integration Techniques

### Theme-Based Integration

Group findings by theme across sources:

```markdown
### Theme: [Topic]

| Aspect | Source 1 | Source 2 | Source 3 | Synthesis |
|--------|----------|----------|----------|-----------|
| [Aspect A] | [Finding] | [Finding] | [Finding] | [Combined view] |
| [Aspect B] | [Finding] | â€” | [Finding] | [Combined view] |
```

### Timeline Integration

For evolving topics:

```markdown
### Timeline: [Topic Evolution]

| Period | Key Developments | Sources |
|--------|------------------|---------|
| [Date range] | [What happened] | [Sources] |
| [Date range] | [What changed] | [Sources] |
| [Current] | [Present state] | [Sources] |
```

### Perspective Integration

For multi-stakeholder views:

```markdown
### Stakeholder Perspectives: [Topic]

| Stakeholder | View | Evidence | Credibility |
|-------------|------|----------|-------------|
| [Group A] | [Their position] | [Supporting data] | [H/M/L] |
| [Group B] | [Their position] | [Supporting data] | [H/M/L] |
```

---

## Stop Hook Integration

```xml
<stop-hook id="HOOK-SYN-001" type="SOFT">
  <trigger>Synthesis from fewer than 3 sources</trigger>
  <validation>
    <check>Single-source limitations acknowledged</check>
    <check>Confidence level appropriately lowered</check>
  </validation>
  <on-pass>Deliver with caveats</on-pass>
  <on-fail>Seek additional sources or flag uncertainty</on-fail>
</stop-hook>

<stop-hook id="HOOK-SYN-002" type="SOFT">
  <trigger>Sources contain significant contradictions</trigger>
  <validation>
    <check>Contradictions explicitly addressed</check>
    <check>Resolution or uncertainty noted</check>
  </validation>
  <on-pass>Present balanced synthesis</on-pass>
  <on-fail>Run contradiction resolution framework</on-fail>
</stop-hook>
```

## Anti-Patterns (Avoid These)

| âŒ Don't | âœ… Do Instead |
|---------|--------------|
| Cherry-pick supporting sources | Consider all relevant sources |
| Treat all sources equally | Weight by credibility |
| Hide contradictions | Surface and address them |
| Present synthesis as fact | Include confidence levels |
| Ignore source dates | Note currency and relevance |
| Skip attribution | Clear provenance for all claims |
| Assume completeness | Identify knowledge gaps |

---

## Rules

```
+cite-all-sources              # Clear provenance
+assess-source-credibility     # Not all sources equal
+surface-contradictions        # Don't hide disagreements
+assign-confidence-levels      # Be honest about certainty
+identify-gaps                 # What we don't know matters
-cherry-pick-evidence          # Consider full picture
-present-synthesis-as-fact     # Acknowledge it's interpretation
-ignore-outliers               # Understand why they differ
```

## Persona Integration

| Persona | Usage |
|---------|-------|
| 003 Market Research Specialist | Primary user for research synthesis |
| 001 Executive Strategic Advisor | Strategic intelligence synthesis |
| 006 Technical Writer | Technical documentation synthesis |
| 008 Legal Expert | Legal research synthesis |
