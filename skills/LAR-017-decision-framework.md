## Purpose

Apply structured decision-making frameworks to complex choices. Transform ambiguous decisions into clear, defensible recommendations with explicit criteria and trade-off analysis.

---

## Core Frameworks

### 1. Decision Matrix (Weighted Scoring)

Best for: Comparing multiple options against defined criteria.

```markdown
## Decision Matrix: [Decision Name]

| Criteria | Weight | Option A | Option B | Option C |
|----------|--------|----------|----------|----------|
| [Criterion 1] | [1-5] | [1-5] | [1-5] | [1-5] |
| [Criterion 2] | [1-5] | [1-5] | [1-5] | [1-5] |
| [Criterion 3] | [1-5] | [1-5] | [1-5] | [1-5] |
| **Weighted Total** | â€” | [sum] | [sum] | [sum] |

**Recommendation:** Option [X] with score [Y]
```

### 2. RAPID Framework

Best for: Clarifying decision roles and accountability.

| Role | Responsibility | Person/Team |
|------|----------------|-------------|
| **R** - Recommend | Proposes decision, gathers input | |
| **A** - Agree | Must agree before decision proceeds | |
| **P** - Perform | Executes once decision is made | |
| **I** - Input | Consulted for expertise/opinion | |
| **D** - Decide | Has final authority | |

### 3. Six Thinking Hats

Best for: Comprehensive analysis from multiple perspectives.

| Hat | Focus | Questions |
|-----|-------|-----------|
| âšª **White** | Facts & Data | What do we know? What data exists? |
| ðŸ”´ **Red** | Emotions & Intuition | How do we feel about this? Gut reaction? |
| âš« **Black** | Risks & Caution | What could go wrong? What are the risks? |
| ðŸŸ¡ **Yellow** | Benefits & Optimism | What are the benefits? Best case scenario? |
| ðŸŸ¢ **Green** | Creativity | What alternatives exist? New ideas? |
| ðŸ”µ **Blue** | Process | What's the next step? How do we decide? |

### 4. Eisenhower Matrix (Urgency/Importance)

Best for: Prioritisation decisions.

```
                    URGENT              NOT URGENT
              â”Œâ”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”¬â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”
  IMPORTANT   â”‚    DO FIRST     â”‚    SCHEDULE     â”‚
              â”‚   Crisis        â”‚   Strategy      â”‚
              â”‚   Deadlines     â”‚   Planning      â”‚
              â”‚   Problems      â”‚   Development   â”‚
              â”œâ”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”¼â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”¤
NOT IMPORTANT â”‚    DELEGATE     â”‚    ELIMINATE    â”‚
              â”‚   Interruptions â”‚   Time wasters  â”‚
              â”‚   Some meetings â”‚   Busy work     â”‚
              â”‚   Some emails   â”‚   Distractions  â”‚
              â””â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”´â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”˜
```

### 5. Pre-Mortem Analysis

Best for: Risk identification before commitment.

```markdown
## Pre-Mortem: [Decision]

**Scenario:** It's 12 months from now. This decision has failed spectacularly.

### What went wrong?
1. [Failure mode 1]
2. [Failure mode 2]
3. [Failure mode 3]

### Warning signs we missed:
- [Sign 1]
- [Sign 2]

### Preventive actions:
| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| [Risk 1] | [Action] |
| [Risk 2] | [Action] |
```

### 6. 10/10/10 Rule

Best for: Time-horizon perspective on decisions.

```markdown
## 10/10/10 Analysis: [Decision]

| Timeframe | How will I feel about this decision? |
|-----------|--------------------------------------|
| **10 minutes** | [Immediate reaction] |
| **10 months** | [Medium-term impact] |
| **10 years** | [Long-term significance] |

**Conclusion:** [Which timeframe matters most for this decision?]
```

## Decision Process Protocol

```
1. FRAME THE DECISION
   â”œâ”€â”€ What exactly are we deciding?
   â”œâ”€â”€ What's the deadline?
   â”œâ”€â”€ Who has decision authority?
   â””â”€â”€ What are the constraints?

2. GATHER INFORMATION
   â”œâ”€â”€ What do we know?
   â”œâ”€â”€ What don't we know?
   â”œâ”€â”€ What can we find out quickly?
   â””â”€â”€ What's unknowable?

3. GENERATE OPTIONS
   â”œâ”€â”€ What are the obvious choices?
   â”œâ”€â”€ What creative alternatives exist?
   â”œâ”€â”€ What's the "do nothing" option?
   â””â”€â”€ What would we do with unlimited resources?

4. EVALUATE OPTIONS
   â”œâ”€â”€ Apply appropriate framework
   â”œâ”€â”€ Score against criteria
   â”œâ”€â”€ Consider risks and trade-offs
   â””â”€â”€ Test assumptions

5. DECIDE
   â”œâ”€â”€ Make the call
   â”œâ”€â”€ Document rationale
   â”œâ”€â”€ Communicate decision
   â””â”€â”€ Define success metrics

6. REVIEW
   â”œâ”€â”€ What did we learn?
   â”œâ”€â”€ Was the process effective?
   â””â”€â”€ How can we improve?
```

## Anti-Patterns (Avoid These)

| âŒ Don't | âœ… Do Instead |
|---------|--------------|
| Analysis paralysis | Set decision deadline, use "good enough" |
| Confirmation bias | Actively seek disconfirming evidence |
| Sunk cost fallacy | Evaluate based on future value only |
| Groupthink | Assign devil's advocate role |
| Recency bias | Consider full historical context |
| Overconfidence | Assign confidence levels, track accuracy |
| Decision by committee | Clarify single decision maker (RAPID-D) |

## Rules

```
+frame-decision-clearly        # Define what we're deciding
+consider-multiple-options     # Never evaluate single option

+identify-decision-maker       # Clear accountability
+set-review-date               # Learn from outcomes
-decide-without-criteria       # Always have evaluation standards
-skip-risk-assessment          # Especially for high-stakes
-assume-reversibility          # Clarify if decision is one-way
