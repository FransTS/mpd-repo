Comprehensive methodology for converting spoken audio/video content into accurate 
written transcripts. Covers verbatim transcription techniques, speaker handling, 
timestamp protocols, and quality assurance procedures.

================================================================================
CORE COMPETENCIES
================================================================================

1. VERBATIM TRANSCRIPTION LEVELS
--------------------------------

STRICT VERBATIM:
Purpose: Legal, research, evidence documentation
Includes:
- Every utterance exactly as spoken
- False starts: "I wasâ€” I mean, I wanted to..."
- Fillers: "um", "uh", "like", "you know", "so", "basically"
- Afrikaans fillers: "nÃ©", "ja-nee", "mos", "sommer"
- Repetitions: "It's it's very important"
- Self-corrections: "Tuesdayâ€” sorry, Wednesday"
- Interruptions: marked with em-dash
- Non-verbal: [laughs], [sighs], [coughs], [sniffs]
- Emphasis: indicated by CAPS or *asterisks*
- Elongation: "Nooo", "Sooo"

CLEAN VERBATIM:
Purpose: Business meetings, interviews, general documentation
Removes:
- Filler words (um, uh, like, you know)
- False starts and stutters
- Unnecessary repetitions
- Throat clearing, coughs (unless significant)
Preserves:
- Complete sentences
- Speaker's intended meaning
- Natural speech patterns
- Relevant non-verbals

INTELLIGENT VERBATIM:
Purpose: Publication, distribution, readability
Applies:
- Light grammatical correction
- Sentence completion
- Coherent paragraph structure
- Professional formatting
Preserves:
- Speaker's voice and tone
- Key phrases and terminology
- Factual accuracy

2. SPEAKER IDENTIFICATION SYSTEM
--------------------------------

KNOWN SPEAKERS:
Format: FULL NAME [TIMESTAMP]
Example: FRANS VERMAAK [00:01:23]

UNKNOWN SPEAKERS:
Format: SPEAKER N [TIMESTAMP]
Assign numbers sequentially by first appearance
Maintain consistency throughout document

GENDER-IDENTIFIED UNKNOWN:
Format: MALE SPEAKER 1 / FEMALE SPEAKER 1
Use only when clearly identifiable

ROLE-BASED (when identity unknown):
Format: CHAIRPERSON / PRESENTER / INTERVIEWER / INTERVIEWEE

SPECIAL CASES:
- [?] - Completely unidentifiable
- [Multiple] - Simultaneous speakers
- [Group] - Collective response (e.g., laughter, agreement)
- [Remote] - Phone/video participant with different audio quality

3. TIMESTAMP METHODOLOGY
------------------------

BASELINE RULES:
- Always start from 00:00 at recording beginning
- Use consistent format throughout document
- Round to nearest second (not milliseconds) for readability
- Include timestamp at EVERY speaker change minimum

SHORT FORMAT (under 60 minutes):
[MM:SS] - e.g., [05:23], [45:07]

LONG FORMAT (60+ minutes):
[H:MM:SS] - e.g., [1:05:23], [2:45:07]

PLACEMENT:
Standard: After speaker name, before speech
SPEAKER NAME [TIMESTAMP]
"Speech content."

Inline (for subtitles): Embedded in content markers

4. CODE-SWITCHING HANDLING
--------------------------

DEFINITION:
Switching between languages mid-conversation or mid-sentence.
Common in South African bilingual contexts.

PRESERVATION RULES:
- Transcribe exactly as spoken
- Do NOT translate
- Do NOT indicate "should be" in other language
- Preserve word order even if grammatically mixed

TAGGING OPTIONS:

No Tags (Default):
"So the meeting is mÃ´re, and we need to prepare the documents."

Inline Tags:
"So the meeting is [AF]mÃ´re[/AF], and we need to prepare the documents."

Language Markers:
[EN] "So the meeting is" [AF] "mÃ´re" [EN] "and we need to prepare the documents."

COMMON PATTERNS:
- English sentence with Afrikaans filler: "It's important, nÃ©?"
- Afrikaans with English technical terms: "Die software moet ge-update word."
- Full switch: "Let me explain. Kom ek verduidelik in Afrikaans."

5. AUDIO QUALITY HANDLING
-------------------------

INAUDIBLE CLASSIFICATIONS:

[inaudible]
- Cannot determine any words
- Brief moment (under 2 seconds)

[inaudible - Xs]
- Extended inaudible section
- Specify approximate duration

[inaudible - background noise]
- Cause identified

[inaudible - crosstalk]
- Multiple speakers causing interference

UNCLEAR CLASSIFICATIONS:

[unclear: "word"?]
- Best phonetic guess
- Question mark indicates uncertainty

[unclear - sounds like "phrase"]
- Longer uncertain section

[unclear - possibly "word1" or "word2"]
- Multiple possibilities

AUDIO EVENT MARKERS:

[recording starts]
[recording ends]
[recording paused]
[recording resumes]
[audio cuts out: START - END]
[silence: Xs]
[background music]
[phone ringing]
[door opens/closes]
[papers shuffling]

6. LONG-FORM TRANSCRIPTION (60+ Minutes)
----------------------------------------

CHUNKING STRATEGY:

Segment Length: 15-20 minutes optimal
Overlap: 30 seconds at boundaries for verification

SEGMENT HEADER FORMAT:
================================================================================
SEGMENT [N] OF [TOTAL] | [START TIME - END TIME]
Speakers: [List active speakers in segment]
Topics: [Brief topic summary - optional]
================================================================================

CONTINUITY MARKERS:
[...continued from Segment N]
[continues in Segment N...]

SPEAKER TRACKING:
- Maintain master speaker list
- Update identifications as they become known
- Note first appearance timestamp for each speaker

QUALITY CHECKPOINTS:
- Verify speaker consistency at segment boundaries
- Cross-reference timestamps across segments
- Check for missing content at transitions

  ]
}

================================================================================
QUALITY ASSURANCE PROCEDURES
================================================================================

PRE-TRANSCRIPTION:
1. Listen to 2-minute sample from start, middle, end
2. Assess overall audio quality (1-5 scale)
3. Identify number of speakers
4. Note language distribution (% each language)
5. Identify technical/specialised terminology
6. Confirm output requirements with client

DURING TRANSCRIPTION:
1. Mark all uncertain sections immediately
2. Note speaker identification challenges
3. Flag potential proper nouns for verification
4. Track timestamp accuracy periodically

POST-TRANSCRIPTION:
1. Full spell-check (both languages)
2. Search for common errors: "teh", "adn", double spaces
3. Verify timestamp accuracy (5 random checks)
4. Confirm speaker consistency
5. Review all [inaudible] and [unclear] markers
6. Calculate and report quality metrics

QUALITY METRICS:
- Word Error Rate (WER): Target <1%
- Speaker Accuracy: Target >98%
- Timestamp Accuracy: Target Â±2 seconds
- Completion Rate: Target 100%
