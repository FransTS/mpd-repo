```

### Frans Value Proposition

```
For enterprises
Who have AI pilots stuck in experimentation
Our Architected Intelligence platform
Is an integrated Eyes+Hands+Brain automation solution

Unlike point solutions or long consulting engagements
We transfer knowledge and prove ROI before scaling
```

### Pain Hunter Diagnostic Framework

The Pain Hunter is the core diagnostic tool for identifying Lighthouse candidates.

#### Value/Complexity Quadrant

```

       LOW â†â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â†’ HIGH
            COMPLEXITY
```

#### Scoring Criteria

**Value Indicators (1-5):**
- Hours saved per week (Ã—hourly rate = annual savings)
- Error rate reduction potential
- Compliance risk mitigation
- Customer experience impact
- Revenue protection/growth

**Complexity Indicators (1-5):**
- Number of systems involved
- Data source fragmentation
- Exception handling requirements
- Regulatory constraints
- Change management needs

#### Tie-Breaker Questions

When use cases score equally:
1. "Which has executive sponsorship today?"
2. "Which has the cleanest data access path?"
3. "Which would make the best internal case study?"
4. "Which has the Evangelist already identified?"

---

### BANT+ Qualification Framework

Extended qualification for Frans engagements.

| Criterion | Discovery Question | Green Flag | Red Flag |
|-----------|-------------------|------------|----------|
| **Budget** | "What's your typical investment range for initiatives like this?" | R500K+ for first Lighthouse | < R500K |
| **Authority** | "Who else needs to be involved in this decision?" | C-level sponsor identified | "Committee will decide" |
| **Need** | "What happens if you don't solve this problem?" | Urgent language, quantified pain | "Nice to have" |
| **Timeline** | "When would you need to see results?" | 6-12 weeks | < 4 weeks or > 6 months |
| **Process** | "Is this process documented and stable?" | SOPs exist, consistent rules | Ad-hoc, pending changes |
| **Data** | "Can you provide sample documents for this process?" | Accessible within 2 weeks | Fragmented, IT blocking |

#### Walk-Away Triggers

**Non-Negotiable STOP conditions:**

| Trigger | Walk-Away Script |
|---------|------------------|
| Budget < R500K | "Our model is designed for R500K+ outcomes. I'd recommend a partner for smaller implementations." |
| No executive sponsor | "Initiatives without executive sponsorship often stall. What would it take to get [CEO/COO] involved?" |
| Unrealistic timeline | "Delivering quality in [X weeks] isn't responsible. Our Lighthouse is 6 weeks for a reason." |
| Blame culture | "Before we proceed, I need to understand: was the previous failure technology, process, or people?" |
| "Build it ourselves" | "You could. But do you have a proven 6-week methodology and 50+ production agents behind you?" |

---

### Product Selection Framework

#### The Agent Trinity

| Component | Function | Product | Indicators |
|-----------|----------|---------|------------|
| **EYES** | Document Processing | AIForged | PDFs, forms, invoices, images, contracts |
| **HANDS** | Process Automation | UiPath | System updates, API calls, multi-app workflows |
| **BRAIN** (Complex) | Reasoning | Microsoft Agentic AI / Azure AI Foundry | Multi-step decisions, orchestration |
| **BRAIN** (Conversational) | Chatbots | Koblai | Customer-facing, help desk, FAQ |

#### Product Selection Questions

```
1. "Does this process involve reading documents, PDFs, or forms?"
   â†’ YES: EYES needed (AIForged)

2. "Do you need to interact with multiple systems (SAP, CRM, etc)?"
   â†’ YES: HANDS needed (UiPath)

3. "Does the process require reasoning, judgment, or complex decisions?"
   â†’ YES: BRAIN needed (Azure AI Foundry)

4. "Do you need a customer-facing chatbot or help desk?"
   â†’ YES: Conversational AI (Koblai)
```

### Competitive Intelligence

#### Response Matrix

| Competitor | Their Claim | Frans Counter |
|------------|-------------|----------------|
| **Microsoft Copilot** | "We have AI built in" | "Copilot assists; our agents do the work. It can't read invoices and update SAP." |
| **Internal AI Team** | "We'll build it ourselves" | "You could. But 6 weeks with proven governance, or 6 months experimenting?" |
| **Automation Anywhere** | "Enterprise scale" | "Complex implementations take 6+ months. We prove value in 6 weeks first." |
| **Big 4 Consulting** | "Strategic transformation" | "We're often the implementation partner that makes their roadmap real." |
| **Previous AI Failure** | "We tried this before" | "Most failures = wrong use case + no governance. Our methodology prevents that." |

#### Differentiation Summary

When competing, emphasise:
1. **Speed:** 6 weeks to production (not 6 months)
2. **Governance:** Anti-hallucination shield (Truth Anchor + Safety + Sovereignty)
3. **Full Stack:** Eyes + Hands + Brain (not just chatbots)
4. **Knowledge Transfer:** You own the agent by Week 6
5. **Proof Points:** 10+ years, 95% retention, 250K hours saved

### Closing Techniques

#### The Workshop Close
> "Here's what I'm proposing: a 90-minute workshopâ€”complimentary, no commitment. We'll run the Pain Hunter exercise, identify your Lighthouse candidate, and you'll leave with a clear next step. If there's a fit, we scope it. If not, you've got a framework you can use internally. Fair enough?"

#### The Lighthouse Close
> "Based on what you've shared, [process name] looks like a strong Lighthouse candidate. Here's the commitment: 6 weeks, fixed scope, measurable outcomes. If we hit the targets, we talk about scaling. If we don't, you have a working agent and we part ways. What would stop you from moving forward?"

#### The ROI Close
> "You mentioned 40 hours per week on [process] at roughly R500/hour. That's R1 million per year. If we can reduce that by 95% in 6 weeks, the payback is under 3 months. Does that math work for your business case?"

## Part 4: Workshop Facilitation

### Engagement Thermometer

| Level | Indicators | Action |
|-------|------------|--------|
| ðŸ”¥ **HIGH** | Leaning forward, note-taking, questions | Maintain pace, go deeper |

### Pivot Playbook

| Situation | Pivot Action |
|-----------|--------------|
| Audience more senior than expected | Switch to Executive Track immediately |
| Technical audience wants depth | Extend product demo, offer follow-up deep-dive |
| Audience already has AI experience | Skip basics, focus on governance differentiators |
| Sceptical/resistant audience | Jump to case study with specific numbers |
| Running out of time | Skip to Pain Hunter, identify ONE candidate |
| One person dominating | "Let's hear from othersâ€”[Name], what's your perspective?" |

### Difficult Participant Archetypes

| Archetype | Behaviour | Handling Strategy |
|-----------|-----------|-------------------|
| **The Sceptic** | Arms crossed, "We've heard this before" | Acknowledge past failures, focus on governance |
| **The Technologist** | Wants to see the code | Park deep questions, position as Architect |
| **The Bureaucrat** | Asks about procurement, compliance | Make them Auditor ally, offer documentation |
| **The Distracted Executive** | Checking phone, leaving for calls | Use their name for key points, engage their #2 |
